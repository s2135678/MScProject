# Ageing in human brain endothelial cells
This MSc project aims to understand the ageing process in human brain endothelial cells using scRNA-seq analysis. To achieve this, two comparisons will be performed:

**1. Young vs. Old adult brain ECs** 
* This comparison will help us better understand the healthy ageing of brain vasculature and allow us to differentiate this from accelerated ageing.

**2. ES-derived ECs vs. Young adult brain ECs** 
* This comparison will help us test the suitability of ES-derived ECs as models for brain ECs and allow us to design better protocols for generating brain ECs from pluripotent sources *in vitro*. 

The files are organised into 4 sub-directories: data, outs, src, and docs
