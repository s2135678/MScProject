# Annotation of clusters 

This section tries to identify clusters at resolution ranging from 0.2-0.5. We hypothesise that some of those cells are ECs, pericytes and smooth muscle cells. Gene markers for ECs and pericytes were found in literatures (Luise and 'Reconstruction of the human bloodâ€“brain barrier in vitro reveals a pathogenic mechanism of APOE4 in pericytes', 2020) : 

* Endothelial:CLDN5, VWF, FLT1, ANO2, ELOVL7 and ABCB1
* Pericytes: PDGFRB, NOTCH3, PRKG1, LAMA2, GPC5, PDE7B, and DLC1
* SMCs: MYH11, TAGLN, ACTA2, LPP and MYL9

## Endothelial 

* Concentrates around upper population of cells. 

```{r, fig.width= 15, fig.height= 13}
FeaturePlot(ecpc, features= c("CLDN5", 
                               "VWF", 
                               "FLT1", 
                               "ANO2", 
                               "ELOVL7", 
                               "ABCB1"))
```

## Pericyte

* Concnetrated in lower population of cells. 

```{r, fig.width= 15, fig.height= 13}
FeaturePlot(ecpc, features= c("PDGFRB", 
                              "NOTCH3", 
                              "PRKG1", 
                              "LAMA2", 
                              "GPC5", 
                              "PDE7B"))
```

## Smooth Muscle cell (vascular cells)

* Highlights a small population off pericyte-like population

```{r, fig.width= 15, fig.height= 13}
FeaturePlot(ecpc, features= c("MYH11", 
                              "TAGLN", 
                              "ACTA2", 
                              "MYL9"))
```

## Annotation at resolution 0.25

Using canonical gene markers for ECs, pericytes and smooth muscle cells, we could annotate cluster 0, 1 and 3. Although cells in cluster 2 appear to express EC gene markers, the cluster seems interesting as it clusters away from the main EC population. 

```{r}
ecpc <- FindClusters(ecpc, resolution = 0.25)
ecpc <- RunUMAP(ecpc, dims = 1:25)
DimPlot(ecpc, reduction="umap", label=TRUE, label.size = 8) + NoLegend()
```

# Feature plots with identified markers 

Here, the main aim is to identify characteristics of cells in cluster 2. However, I also performed DE analysis on clusters 0, 1, and 3 just to double check the cell identity.  

## Gene Marker Identification

Seurat uses function FindAllMarkers() to identify positive and negative gene markers of one cluster, compared to all other cells. So, if a gene in cluster 0 has avg.log2FC of 2.0 with highly significant adjusted p-value, then, cells in cluster 0 express the gene on average 2-fold more than cells in cluster 1 and 2.    

* min.pct : if min.pct = 0.25, genes that are expressed in 25% of cells in either of the two populations are only tested. This reduces computational cost as irrelavant genes are not tested.
* logfc.threshold : only those genes with average log X-fold difference between two groups of cells are tested.  
* only positive gene markers are returned. 
* By default, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test is used but here, I chose to use MAST because literatures have identified MAST to be best performing single-cell DE testing method. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Set cell identity class to clustering resolution 0.2
Idents(ecpc) <- "RNA_snn_res.0.25"

# Finds gene markers in each cluster compared to all other cells 
ecpc.markers <- FindAllMarkers(ecpc, 
                               only.pos = TRUE, 
                               min.pct = 0.25, 
                               logfc.threshold = 0.25,
                               test.use = "MAST")
```

The results below show 10 gene markers for each cluster ordered with highest log2FC: 

* unadjusted p-value 
* log2 fold-change of average expression between two groups. Positive value indicates that cells in first group express the feature more 
* pct1: percentage of cells that express the feature in group 1
* pct2: percentage of cells that express the feature in group 2
* adjusted p-value after Bonferroni correction 

Since only positive gene markers are reported here, pct.1 > pct.2. At this point, you can further filter gene markers based on 4 parameters.

* pct1 > 0.25% is quite a normal threshold. 
* pct2 depends on your dataset. If your dataset contains similar cells, pct2 < 0.25 is suitable whereas, if dataset contains heterogenous population of cells, pct2 < 0.6 is suitable. 
* adjusted p-value < 0.05 for significant results 
* log2fc should be considered because if all cells are expressing very poorly but only slightly different, those genes are not significant. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
top10_markers <- ecpc.markers %>% group_by(cluster) %>% top_n(n = 10, wt = avg_log2FC)
top10_markers
```

## Cluster 0 

* Known gene markers for ECs seen (ABCB1 and THSD4): further confirms that cluster 0 is ECs

```{r}
# This function takes result from DE analysis and creates feature plots 
DEG_feature_plot_func <- function(seur_object,
                                  markers){
  
  # Converts data.frame into string of DEGs
  gene.markers <- as.character(as.matrix(markers))
  
  # Create feature plot using makers 
  feat_plot <- FeaturePlot(seur_object, 
                           features = c(gene.markers))
  print(feat_plot)
}
```


```{r, fig.width= 15, fig.height= 13}
# Cluster 0 annotation with 10 identified markers 
clust0_markers <- top10_markers[1:10, 'gene']
DEG_feature_plot_func(ecpc, clust0_markers)
```

## Cluster 1 gene marker 

* Known pericyte markers seen (PRKG1, GPC5, DLC1)

```{r, fig.width= 15, fig.height= 13}
# Cluster 1 top 10 gene markers 
clust1_markers <- top10_markers[11:20, 'gene']
DEG_feature_plot_func(ecpc, clust1_markers)
```

## Cluster 2 gene marker

* See later thorough analysis on this cluter. 

```{r, fig.width= 15, fig.height= 13}
# Cluster 2 top 10 gene markers 
clust2_markers <- top10_markers[21:30, 'gene']
DEG_feature_plot_func(ecpc, clust2_markers)
```

## Cluster 3 gene marker 

* SMC gene markers identified. 

```{r, fig.width= 15, fig.height= 13}
# Cluster 3 top 10 gene markers 
clust3_markers <- top10_markers[31:40, 'gene']
DEG_feature_plot_func(ecpc, clust3_markers)
```

So far, cluster 0, 1, and 3 have been identified to be ECs, pericytes and SMCs. Cluster 2 appears to be ECs as well but still interesting. 

# Annotation at resolution = 0.5

Here, I attempt to identify the two sub-clusters in endothelial population. Initially I thought it could be different vessel-types (arterioles, venuoles and capillary), but it turns out that it was quality. This is also true for pericyte sub-population 

```{r}
ecpc <- FindClusters(ecpc, resolution = 0.5)
ecpc <- RunUMAP(ecpc, dims = 1:25)
DimPlot(ecpc, reduction="umap", label=TRUE, label.size = 8) + NoLegend()

FeaturePlot(ecpc, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA"))
```

# Conclusion

Since sub-clusters in EC population is due to quality, clusters will be annotated at resolution 0.25. The Endothelial_2 population is still unknown but next section will try address this.  

```{r}
Idents(ecpc) <- "RNA_snn_res.0.25"
new.cluster.ids <- c("Endothelial_1", "Pericyte", "Endothelial_2", "SMC")
names(new.cluster.ids) <- levels(ecpc)
ecpc <- RenameIdents(ecpc, new.cluster.ids)
DimPlot(ecpc, reduction = "umap", label = TRUE, label.size = 8) + NoLegend()
```

```{r}
# Save annotated RDS 
saveRDS(ecpc, "/Users/serachoi/Documents/Edinburgh/MScProject/Project/data/processed/ecpc04.RDS")
```
